It was made with the thought in mind to have a pretty simple tool\r\nfor playing sound/music in a game or another multimedia application.\r\n\r\nWARNING: This is a pretty early version, keep in mind, that method/classes can be removed/renamed/changed at any time.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nSimple Audio Library is released under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\r\n\r\n## Platform\r\n\r\nFor now, it is only build for Mac OS X. But Windows will be also supported as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n## How to build\r\n\r\n**Mac OS X**\r\n\r\n- Open your console and go to ```\"[directory of your copy]/Code/\"```\r\n- Enter: ```make```\r\n\r\nNow it'll compile the library on your machine and after it's finished it copies all header files into:\r\n```\"[directory of your copy]/Header/\"``` and the bineary to\r\n```\"[directory of your copy]/Lib/\"```.\r\n\r\nSo, to use this library in your application, all you have to do is to set the header path to:\r\n```\"[directory of your copy]/Header/\"``` and the library path to:\r\n```\"[directory of your copy]/Lib/\"``` and here we go, you're ready to work with this libary.\r\n\r\n### Visual Studio Code\r\n\r\nThe current version also includes a tasks configuration file for Visual Studio Code. All you have to\r\ndo is to open the project in Visual Studio Code and hit ```CTRL + Shift + B``` to start the build process\r\ndirectly in Visual Studio Code.\r\n\r\n## Code Example\r\n\r\nThis is the simplest version to work with this library:\r\n```c++\r\n// include needed header file\r\n#include <SimpleAudioLib/CoreSystem.h>\r\n\r\n// before you can use this library, you have to initialize it\r\nSimpleAudioLib::CoreSystem& system = SimpleAudioLib::CoreSystem::getInstance();\r\n\r\nsystem.initWithDefaultDevice();\r\n\r\n// load audio file in wave format\r\nSimpleAudioLib::AudioEntity* sound = system.createAudioEntityFromFile(\"YourAudioFile.wav\");\r\n\r\n// play sound\r\nsound.play();\r\n\r\n// clean up\r\ndelete sound;\r\nsound = NULL;\r\n\r\nSimpleAudioLib::CoreSystem::release();\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
